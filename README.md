## Usage

### Prepare the image data sets

In order to start the transfer learning process, a folder named `training_dataset` needs to be created in the root of the project folder. This folder will contain the image data sets for all the subjects, for whom the classification is to be performed.

[Download the Datasets here](https://bit.ly/3mcb3aS)

Create the `training_dataset` folder and add the images for all the data sets in the following manner -

```javascript
/
|
|
---- /training_dataset
|    |
|    |
|    ---- /plastics
|    |    plastic1.jpg
|    |    plastic2.jpg
|    |    ...
|    |
|    |
|    ---- /paper
|         paper1.jpg
|         paper2.jpg
|         ...
|
|
```

This enables classification of images between the `plastics` and `paper` data sets. Image Augmentation techniques have also been applied here to increase the dataset

> Make sure to include multiple variants of the subject (side profiles, zoomed in images etc.), the more the images, the better is the result.

### Initiate transfer learning

Go to the project directory and run -

```javascript
$ bash train.sh
```

This script installs the `Inception` model and initiates the re-training process for the specified image data sets.

Once the process is complete, it will return a training accuracy somewhere between `85% - 100%`.

The `training summaries`, `retrained graphs` and `retrained labels` will be saved in a folder named `tf_files`.

### Classify objects

```python
python classify.py
```

### Live Inferencing with Camera

```python
python inference.py
```

---

To run the RESTApi server, make sure you have nodejs installed

### Rest API Server

```javascript
node RestAPI.js
```
