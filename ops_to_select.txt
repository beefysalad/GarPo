# List of ops that are not supported by the native TFLite runtime and may require
# fallback to TensorFlow kernels.
#
# This list may change over time as new TensorFlow Lite versions are released.
#
# To enable TF kernel fallback, pass this file to the --ops_to_select flag of
# the TFLite converter, like this:
#
#   $ tflite_convert --ops_to_select=ops_to_select.txt ...
#
# The file format is simply a list of operation names, one per line.
#
# If you want to add your own custom ops to this list, you can create a new
# file with your additional ops and pass it to the --allow_custom_ops flag of
# the TFLite converter, like this:
#
#   $ tflite_convert --allow_custom_ops --ops_to_select=my_ops.txt ...


# Ops not supported in TFLite versions < 2.4.0:
